This extension allows users to play a bingo game about the streamer erobb221 and throw virtual tomatoes at the screen.

The overlay uses a built-in chatbot to display the bingo board.

ChangeLog:

- Made the tab to open the bingo board in the overlay smaller
- Chat can now throw tomatoes at the screen for 15 seconds when a mod types !startthrowing and chat types TomatoTime

Chatbot Commands:

- !bingo: opens the overlay bingo board
- !startthrowing: 15 second timer starts that allows chat to throw virtual tomatoes at the screen by typing TomatoTime
